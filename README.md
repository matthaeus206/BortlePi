## üß† Software Overview

The main script performs the following operations:

1. **Initialization**: Sets up I2C communication and configures LED pins.
2. **Sensor Reading**: Continuously reads lux values from the VEML7700 sensor.
3. **Data Smoothing**: Applies a moving average to stabilize readings.
4. **Bortle Scale Calculation**: Maps the averaged lux value to the corresponding Bortle scale.
5. **LED Update**: Illuminates the appropriate LED based on the Bortle scale.
6. **Error Handling**: Attempts to reinitialize the sensor upon read failures.
7. **Resource Monitoring**: Prints available RAM to the console for debugging.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **CircuitPython Setup**: Install CircuitPython on your RP2040-Zero.
2. **Library Installation**: Add the `adafruit_veml7700` library to the `lib` directory on your device.
3. **Code Deployment**: Upload the main script to your RP2040-Zero as `code.py`.
4. **Power Up**: Connect the device to a power source via USB.
5. **Observation**: Monitor the serial output for lux and Bortle scale readings; observe LED indicators for visual feedback.

## üìà Bortle Scale Thresholds

The mapping from lux values to Bortle scale levels is defined as follows:

```python
BORTLE_THRESHOLDS = [
    (0.01, 1), (0.08, 2), (0.3, 3),
    (1.0, 4), (4.0, 5), (10.0, 6),
    (30.0, 7), (100.0, 8),
]
```

Lux values exceeding 100 default to Bortle scale 9.

## üìù Notes

- Ensure only the 3V3 pin is used to power the VEML7700 sensor to prevent damage.
- The moving average window size and loop interval can be adjusted in the configuration section of the script to fine-tune responsiveness.
